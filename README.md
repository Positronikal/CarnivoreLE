CarnivoreLE

CarnivoreLE is a forensically-sound preview/triage tool for live systems that runs on Windows, GNU/Linux, and Macintosh systems for the purpose of collecting live and volatile data. It ships complete with RAM capture and logical media imaging for all three systems as well. It is part of the larger Carnivore project that includes a fully featured forensic operating system, network server, and integrated automation to form a private cloud-like forensic environment.

CarnivoreLE will continue as part of the project, but has been rewritten from C to Golang, is covered under a different license, and is not hosted publicly.
